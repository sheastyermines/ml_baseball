    <h3>Welcome to our Final Project for Machine Learning!</h3>
    <p>
      Our final project uses machine learning with the big data of MLB Statistics to
      predict how a team will perform by using a couple different approaches.

    <h3> The Data </h3>
    <p>
	  A guy named Sean Lahman created a massive archive of baseball statistics that date back to 1871. 
	    This archive is completely free to use by the public. Data in this database include pitching, batting, 
	    fielding statistics, standings, team stats, managerial records, post-season data, and more. 
	    A lot of columns in this data had to have been cleaned out as there were certain categories that were just not 
	    applicable to predicting our model. We found that modern sabre-metrics and statistics were more consistently
	    and accurately recorded after 1997, so we decided to use the data from that year onward. 1997 was 
	    also the year that the youngest two franchises (ARI, TB) began playing in the MLB.
	  <br>
	  <br>

	  Disclaimer: Be Warned, for both models testing them using our data may produce unusually good results as they may have been included in the training set. Our mean absolute errors are reported only on our testing set and are a better indicator of the validity of the results you get. This application is just provided as a fun way to demonstrate the model.

    <h3> The First Model </h3>
    <p>
	<br>
	(For year Y)
	<br>
	<br>
	Features: Rank, Home Games, Runs, At Bats, Hits, Doubles, Triples, Home Runs, Walks, Strikeouts, Stolen Bases, Caught Stealing, Opponent's Runs Scored, Earned Runs, Earned Run Average, Complete Games, Shutouts, Saves, Outs Pitched, Hits Allowed, Home Runs Allowed, Walks Allowed, Strikeouts by Pitchers, Errors, Double Plays, Fielding percentage, Total Home Attendance, Park Factor for Batters, and Park Factor for Batters.
	<br>
	<br>
	Target: Year Y Wins
	<br>
	<br>
	This model is intended to predict how many wins a specific team had acquired given their non-WL data for that year.  It uses 3 100 node fully connected layers. All nodes use linear activation functions. Standard Gradient descent is used as an optimizer and mean square error is used as a loss function. The model is trained for 200 epochs.
	<br>
	<br>
	Test mean absolute error: 2.44 games

    <h3> The Second Model </h3>
    <p>

	<br>
	(For year Y and using the N previous years model)
	<br>
	<br>
	Features: The following features for each of the N previous years: Rank, Games, Home Games, Wins, Losses, Runs, At Bats, Hits, Doubles, Tripples, Home Runs, Walks, Strikeouts, Stolen Bases, Caught Stealing, Opponent's Runs Scored, Earned Runs, Earned Run Average, Complete Games, Shutouts, Saves, Outs Pitched, Hits Allowed, Home Runs Allowed, Walks Allowed, Strikeouts by Pitchers, Errors, Double Plays, Fielding percentage, Total Home Attendance, Park Factor for Batters, and Park Factor for Batters.
	<br>
	<br>
	Target: Year Y Wins
	<br>
	<br>
	This model is intended to predict how many wins a specific team will acquire given their previous N years of accomplishments. It uses 4 fully connected 100 node layers with 10% dropout on each one to curb overfitting. All nodes use relu as an activation function. Standard gradient descent is used as an optimizer and mean square error is used as a loss function. The model is trained for 1000 epochs.
	<br>
	<br>
	Actual Results:
	<br>
	<br>
	N=1: Test mean absolute error: 8.9956 games
	<br>
	N=3: Test mean absolute error: 8.3953 games
	<br>
	N=5: Test mean absolute error: 8.0164 games
	<br>
	<br>
	Results when using a normalized sized training set (just as an accademic intrest):
	<br>
	<br>
	N=1: Test mean absolute error: 9.1015 games (normalized size in training set)
	<br>
	N=3: Test mean absolute error: 8.7836 games (normalized size in training set)
	<br>
	N=5: Test mean absolute error: 8.0164 games (normalized size in training set)
	<br>
